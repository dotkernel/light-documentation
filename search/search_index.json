It is a good practice to standardize the file structure of projects. When using DotKernel Light, the following structure is installed by default: Main directories bin - various helper scripts config - various configuration files data - should contain project-related data log - storage of log files generated by dot-error-log library public - publicly visible files. The webserver need to have this folder as www-document root folder. src - should contain the source code files test - should contain the test files bin directory This directory contains one file, clear-config-cache.php which removes the config cache file ( data/cache/config-cache.php - available only when development mode is enabled). config directory This directory contains all application-related config files: config.php : here you will register ConfigProviders after installing packages container.php : main service container, providing access to all registered services development.config.php.dist : gets symlinked as development.config.php when enabling development mode - activates debug mode pipeline.php : contains a list of middlewares, in their order of execution twig-cs-fixer.php : configuration file for Twig code style checker/fixer autoload directory This directory contains all service-related local and global config files: app.global.php : sets the application name dependencies.global.php : config file to set global dependencies that should be accessible by all modules development.local.php.dist : gets symlinked as development.local.php when enabling development mode - activates error handlers error-handling.global.php : configures and activates error logs local.php.dist : local config file where you can overwrite application name and URL mezzio.global.php : Mezzio core config file templates.global.php : dotkernel/dot-twigrenderer config file data directory This directory is a storage for project data files and service caches. Inside you will find: cache : Twig's cache directory AVOID storing sensitive data on VCS. log directory This directory stores daily log files. When you access the application from the browser, (if not already created) a new log file gets created in the format specified in the config/autoload/error-handling.global.php config file under the stream array key. public directory This directory contains all publicly available assets and serves as the entry point of the application: css : contains app.css , a single file containing the entire CSS code collected from all modules, in a minified form fonts : contains app , a directory containing custom font files collected from all modules images : contains app , a directory containing all image files collected from all modules js : contains app.js , a single file containing the entire JavaScript code collected from all modules, in a minified form .htacess : server configuration file used by Apache web server - this file enables the URL rewrite functionality index.php : the application's main entry point robots.txt.dist : a sample robots.txt file, providing settings allow/deny bot access to certain areas of your application - activate it by duplicating the file as robots.txt and comment out the lines that don't match your environment src directory This directory contains two directories, called modules: App Page App directory This is the App module. It contains all generic functionalities your application depends on. The assets directory contains all generic assets, reusable across the application. The src contains ConfigProvider.php , a file that sets template path aliases ( getTemplates ) but can also provide dependencies ( getDependencies ). The templates : contains misc components like the home page, custom error pages, template partials and the default layout template. Page directory This is the Page module. It contains page-related components for your application. The src directory contains the following items: Controller : contains module controllers Factory : contains module factories, which are used to provide ready-to-use instances of certain classes Service : contains module service files, which contain classes that provide custom functionalities ConfigProvider.php - provides module configuration data RoutesDelegator.php - stored main routes found in the module The templates directory contains the page directory, with template files for various web pages.
